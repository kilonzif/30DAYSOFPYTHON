# 30DAYSOFPYTHON

This is an open-source project guide for learning Python Programming Language .

Fork it and create separate branches/folders for each day. 

## Topics Breakdown

### Day 1: Python Basics
Start by installing Python and a text editor. Learn the basics of Python, such as: 
 variables, data types, Math Operators, Comments, Input() function, Print() function, The str(), int(), and float() Functions

#### Exercise
Simple Python Calculator Program: Write a simple program that does basic math operations including addition, subtraction, deletion, division, power, squareroot,etc,. 


### Day 2: Python Control Flow - IF Statements, Logical and Comparator Operations

Learn how to use control flow statements like if-else statements, Switch-Case Statement,Logical Operators (and, OR), Boolean operators and comparisonooperations such as <, >, !==, ==, etc

#### Exercise
You are building a program to help a user decide what to wear based on the current weather conditions. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the current temperature in Fahrenheit and whether it is currently raining or not (as a boolean value), and then suggests an appropriate outfit based on the following criteria:

If the temperature is less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit, suggest wearing a coat, hat, scarf, and gloves.
If the temperature is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is not raining, suggest wearing a sweater or light jacket.
If the temperature is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is raining, suggest wearing a rain jacket and boots.
If the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is not raining, suggest wearing a t-shirt and shorts.
If the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is raining, suggest wearing a light jacket and rain boots.


### Day 3: Loops and Iteration in Python 
Understand how to apply Loops and iteration in python programs. 
*** While loops:With boolean values, do-while loop too
*** For Loops: Using Indexing,using range(), Using items, looping over sequential data (sets, dictionaries, lists, tuples) 
*** For-Else statements
*** Break and Continue Statements

#### Exercise
    Fibonacci: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer n, and then prints the first n Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.


### Day 4: Functions In Python 
Understand the concept of functions in Python. A function is a block of organized code that is used to perform a single task. They provide better modularity for your application and reuse-ability.
A function can take arguments and return values:

#### Exercise:
    1.write a function in python that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the given numbers. 

    2. write a function in python that takes a list of numbers and returns the second-largest item in the list of the given numbers. 

     3. write a function in python that takes 3 parameters: name, age, and occupation and prints this sentence as output: "My name is {name}, I am {age} years old and I work as a {occupation}". 

### Day 5: Strings and String Manipulations
